This is my take on the Zimnat Insurance Recommendation Challenge (Held on Zindi).

It was my first attempt at a multi-classification problem with a grossly unbalanced dataset.

What I did well:
1) Experimented with new ways for feature engineering
2) Attempted automating as many process as possible
3) Modular functions
4) Learnt about the mechanisms (math) and concepts of decision trees and random forest

What I didn't do so well:
1) Did not take into consideration the distribution of labels --> Eventually led to not being able to achieve any cross validation
2) Did not visualise the machine learning process. Largely a black box.

Happy reading!
